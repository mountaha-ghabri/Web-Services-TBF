## **Tunisian Book Fair Project**

### **About the Project**
This is a web application created for my **Web Services academic course**. The platform aims to promote the **Tunisian literary legacy**, focusing on accessibility and inclusivity. It allows users to:
- Explore **Braille books**, **audiobooks**, and **research papers**.
- Register and log in to access additional features.
- Lay the groundwork for future functionalities like **book signings**, **meetups**, and **analytics**.

The project combines **frontend, backend**, and **database integration** to showcase practical web service development.

### **Key Features**

   - Users can register and log in with roles like Reader, Author, Publisher, or Organizer.
   - Basic security measures implemented (passwords are hashed).

2. **Book Listings**:

   - Dynamically display books from the database.

3. **Accessible Design**:
